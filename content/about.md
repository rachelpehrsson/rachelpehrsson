My name is Rachel Pehrsson. I am a front-end programmer at [Sapio Sciences LLC](https://sapiosciences.com) in York, PA. In 2018, I graduated from the University of Virginia with degrees in Computer Science and Studio Art. My passions include web development, Edtech, illustration, and making your company's dynamically generated PDFs look very swanky. 

In my free time, I enjoy painting, writing, swing dancing, listening to music, reading comic books, and playing with my cat, Toby. He's the charmer of the household.
